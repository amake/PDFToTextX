        <div id="main">
        <p>If you no longer want to use a certain iPod with iPodBackup, it is recommended that you remove the iPod from iPodBackup's preferences.</p>
        <p>Note:  If you only want to temporarily prevent an iPod from being backed up to, you can simply uncheck the checkbox next to the iPod's name in the Preferences window.</p>
        <p>To remove an iPod, first go to "Preferences..." in the iPodBackup application menu.  Then select an iPod in the list and click the <img src="../images/minusbutton.png" alt="[-]" height="14px" /> button near the bottom of the window.  A sheet will appear asking if you want to delete the backup.</p>
        <img src="../images/removeipodsheet.png" alt="[Remove iPod sheet screenshot]" class="screenshot" />
        <p>If you choose to delete the backup data, the folder or disk image will be permanently erased.  If you choose not to delete, the folder or disk image will be renamed to <code>username disabled</code> or <code>username disabled.sparseimage</code>, respectively.</p>
