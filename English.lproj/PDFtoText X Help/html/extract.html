			<h2>Extracting</h2>
            <p>PDFtoText X allows you to easily extract all textual data from one or more PDFs.</p>
			<p>To begin, simply input one or more PDFs in any of the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Select "Open..." from the File menu.</li>
				<li>Click the "Select a file..." button on the main window.</li>
				<li>Drag-and-drop PDF(s) onto the main window.</li>
				<li>Drag-and-drop PDF(s) onto the application icon in the Finder or in the Dock.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If "Refresh text preview automatically" is enabled, the extracted text will automatically appear in the right-hand side pane. If not, click "Go" to begin extracting. Extracting is usually very fast, though in some cases it can take a few seconds (especially when extracting from large PDFs accessed over slower network connections).</p>
			<p>See <a href="advanced.html">Advanced Settings</a> for more information about extraction options.</p>
			<p>Once the text has been extracted you can edit it in the preview pane before saving it.</p>
			<h2>Saving</h2>
			<p>If "Automatically save results" was checked when you began extraction, the extracted text file is already in the specified destination folder. If your original PDF was named <code>MyDocument.pdf</code>, then the extracted text file will be <code>MyDocument.txt</code>.</p>
			<p>If the results were not automatically saved, or if you have made changes to the text in the preview pane, save the results by clicking the "Save..." button, or click "Copy" to copy the text to the clipboard.</p>
